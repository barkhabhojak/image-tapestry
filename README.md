# image-tapestry

Final project for a course on Multimedia Systems Design at the University of Southern California (Fall 2017). The idea is to extract important keyframes from a given video file in an RGB format and sync with the audio provided in a WAV format. The project also introduces the concept of an image tapestry to present the highlights of the video.

## Running
In order to run the code, pull the files and create the following folders:
  1. foreground
  2. keyframes
  3. resources - This is where the .wav and .rgb file will be located
  4. seamcarve
  
In Main.java, you may change the input files and set threshold values.
