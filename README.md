# image-tapestry

Final project for a course on Multimedia Systems Design at the University of Southern California (Fall 2017). The idea is to extract important keyframes from a given video file in an RGB format and sync with the audio provided in a WAV format. The project also introduces the concept of an image tapestry to present the highlights of the video.
