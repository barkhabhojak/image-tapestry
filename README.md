# image-tapestry

Project at USC for a course on Multimedia Systems Design. The idea revolves around creating an image tapestry which would summarise the given video. On clicking a portion of the image tapestry, the video would buffer from that particular key frame. Input formats are .rgb for the video and .wav for the audio.
